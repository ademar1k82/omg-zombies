# OMG ZOMBIES
Hey! What happened??? I woke up strange... 
A laboratory leakage made a zombie virus to spread very quickly... 
Fortunately, there is a cure for this. It takes 3 doses to be safe.
Come on, go get them!

"OMG Zombies" is a 3-level platformer that consists in getting the potions and 
getting away from the zombies that come ahead of you. You have to do this within a time limit.

The game was made in MonoGame framework, with my fellow partner Luís Pereira.

### Decisions made
The goal that the two members of the group set out from the beginning was always to create a Platform Game. In the course of its creation, decisions were being designed based on the research and acquisition of theoretical knowledge in MonoGame.

In this way, it was chosen a game of collection of objects, with escape from the enemies that were being placed on the game map. We chose not to make a too complex game, abolishing the implementation of ideas such as:
- Put a background of the type "parallax scrolling";
- Minimum number of objects to be collected by each level;
- Creation of projectiles to destroy enemies.


### Game instructions
- Collects the healing potions;
- Avoid the Zombies with no return;
- Arrive at the shelter line before the end of time;
- Have fun saving the life of this IPCA student before EDJD22 completely overwhelms him!
